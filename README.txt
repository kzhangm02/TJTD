TJTD is an automated SQBS file generator using game statisics compiled in a .xlsx file. TJTD must be used 
in accordance with the TJ stats spreadsheet. Currently, TJTD only supports tournaments run using NAQT rules.

TJTD requires both game statistics and a root SQBS file containing all teams/rosters/divisions. Each team 
name and player name must exactly match how they appear on the .xlsx sheet.

TJTD will produce two text files that lists errors and notes. It is up to the operator to manually fix 
errors and take into account the notes. Sometimes, TJTD will throw an unexpected error. It is up to the 
operator to manually fix the error. Do not panic if no error is found. Occasionally, the unexpected error 
can be fixed by simply opening the .xlsx file to the correct round.

**Lastly, it is very important that the 'SetupFiles' folder name and content is NOT MODIFIED.

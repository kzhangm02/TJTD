Brief Instructions:

RTD requires a tournament folder, a blank SQBS file with team names and rosters, and starting/ending round. 
The tournament folder should contain all relevant scoresheets and the blank SQBS file (without any games) ONLY. 
Team rosters and divisions should NOT be in the tournament folder.

RTD will only create the stats file if there are no errors with the scoresheets. 
The errors will be listed in the "Errors" section, along with the file and round where the error occurred. 
The detection of unexpected errors (rare) is manual. 
All common errors involve incorrect spelling. Be careful with spelling.
The stats file will be created inside the tournament folder in other folder named "Stats."

IMPORTANT: RTD requires the folder named "SetupFiles." 
Put the setup files folder and RTD in the same folder and DO NOT MODIFY the name of "SetupFiles."

The online scoresheets are used to track game statistics. 
The "Add Substitutions" button identifies which players are currently playing on row 3 of each scoresheet. 
Enter a player's name on the top before adding substitutions.
Do not modify the script editor which is responsible for tracking substitutions.

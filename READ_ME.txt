Brief Instructions:

RTD requires a tournament folder, a blank SQBS file with team names and rosters, and starting/ending round. 
The tournament folder should contain all relevant scoresheets and the blank SQBS file ONLY. 
Team rosters and divisions should NOT be in the tournament folder.

SQBS will only create the stats file if there are no errors with the scoresheets. 
The errors will be listed in the "Errors" section, along with the file and round where the error occurred. 
The errors are self explanatory except for the unexpected error (rare). 
Obviously, this will occur when there is an error that is not already accounted for. 
The detection of unexpected errors is manual. 
All common errors involve incorrect spelling, so just be careful.

The stats file will be created inside the tournament folder in other folder named "Stats."

IMPORTANT: RTD requires the folder named "SetupFiles." 
Put the setup files folder and RTD in the same folder and DO NOT MODIFY the name of "SetupFiles."

The online scoresheets are used to track game statistics. 
It is suggested that people with access to the tjquizbowl email use their personal email as to not edit protected ranges. 
The addition to the scoresheet is the method of substitutions. 
The "Add Substitutions" button identify which players are currently playing on row 3 of each scoresheet. 
Enter a player's name on the top before adding substitutions.
Do not modify the script editor which is responsible for tracking substitutions.
